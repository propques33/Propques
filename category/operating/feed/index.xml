<p>When it comes to the bright and bouncing-back world of the coworking industry, making high profits is not limited to the desks and Wi-Fi setup alone. It all comes down to thinking outside the box and coming up with pretty intelligent ways for making that extra moolah. Here are five simple ways through which you can explain to your coworking space on how best it can derive revenue and stay ahead.</p>



<p>1. Host Fun Events: Make Your Space the Place to Be Turn your coworking space into a cool events spot that people love to visit. From workshops to parties, several other things might be happening in the space, including giving birth to some of the trends.<br><br>By hosting events at the center, they reveal the space not only by renting it but also renting drinks and snacks sold at the occasion and helping in organizing the event. With some clever marketing, your space could become the go-to spot for all kinds of gatherings.</p>



<p>2. Special Membership Offer: Treat Your best customers like vIPs<br></p>



<p>Offer a special membership package to your most valued customers in such a way that makes them feel really special, exceeding the levels of a typical customer. Private desks, inviting space to exclusive events, or personal help when they need it. If people are ready to pay more for privileged treatment, such types of memberships also raise your space&#8217;s revenue.</p>



<p>&nbsp;3.Froster connections and a collaborative environment: Build connections and boost your earnings by collaborating with other businesses. Create exclusive offers for your members, such as discounted gym memberships conveniently located just across the street. Forge partnerships with nearby cafes to ensure that your members always enjoy affordable coffee options. Let&#8217;s foster a community where networking not only leads to friendships but also to financial benefits.</p>



<p>To sum up, by helping you work with others, this section will help you give extra value to your members, and hopefully, earn yourself some extra cash along the way through referral fees and other agreements.</p>



<p>4. Be Flexible: Change with the Times<br><br>The way people work is always changing, so it&#8217;s important to be flexible.Offer different kinds of workspaces, like virtual offices or short-term rentals, which would meet different people&#8217;s needs. Being versatile guarantees that you are occupying 100 percent space, hence an assured opportunity to make that extra dollar around the clock all year.</p>



<p>5. Offer Extra Services: Give People What They Want<br><br>Think of what else your members may need and offer it. They most likely need computer help or would like to learn some new skills. You will also have a chance at earning an extra profit and, in the process, create satisfaction among them through additional services like IT support or workshops.</p>



<p>In summary, therefore, the quest to make more in this business leaves one to have to be creative, work with others, and give people what they want. There are easy approaches for the host of events, special memberships, partnering with others, being flexible, and offering extra services that could help increase revenues and make the coworking space successful.</p>

<p>Coworking spaces are a boon for startups and small businesses. They are cost effective, flexible, and allow people from diverse backgrounds to congregate and collaborate with each other to resolve business and social challenges of the day. These benefits gave rise to a spike of coworking office leasing from 8 percent in 2018 to 14 percent in 2019.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In recent few years, larger companies too, especially in the tech industry, have started identifying the benefits of operating in a coworking space. In fact, a survey conducted by a real estate firm showcased that 40 to 45 percent of demand came from large firms. This demand for coworking office lease was followed by the SME sector at 35 to 40 percent, and interestingly the demand from start-ups came at just 15-25 percent.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Large corporations are able to network and tap into a rich talent pool to making collaborations and acquisitions, flexibility of operations, reduced overhead cost.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s deep-dive into how large organizations are taking advantage of coworking for expansion:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol><!-- wp:list-item --></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><ol><li><strong>Talent and Innovation</strong></li></ol></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Coworking spaces offer easy access to talent and innovation. So, it allows large companies to stay closer to the action and initiate strategic acquisitions with potential industry disruptors. Cowork spaces also help corporate zero down on possible acquisition targets in the future.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} --></p>
<ol start="2">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="2"><!-- wp:list-item --></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><ol start="2"><li><strong>The Coworking Trend Survives COVID-19 Better</strong></li></ol></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With flexible workstation options and lower CAPEX investment requirements over traditional offices, coworking spaces have helped businesses save on cost.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} --></p>
<ol start="3">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="3"><!-- wp:list-item --></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><ol start="3"><li><strong>Flexibility Options</strong></li></ol></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Work from a shared office space offers great flexibility when it comes to testing out a new location and operational hours. For instance, if a business needs to work on a special project that requires setting up a satellite or remote office, it is convenient to choose a coworking space than to lease for a fixed amount of time. Similarly, if a company finds the location of a particular coworking space suitable for their needs, it gives them an opportunity for expansion as well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Even the company employees can now opt between working at a head office or operating from a convenient location.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} --></p>
<ol start="4">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="4"><!-- wp:list-item --></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><ol start="4"><li><strong>Low Rental Cost</strong></li></ol></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thanks to coworking spaces, large corporations can save on their operational costs, opportunity cost, and also rental cost. They also spend less on internet, furniture, reception, housekeeping, and other office facilities.</p>

<p>Co-working spaces were traditionally used by startups, freelancers or business owners but in recent times there has been an upward trend in students who are planning to join coworking spaces. Coworking spaces tend to provide students with a professional atmosphere and an opportunity to collaborate and socialise with people from different professions. In this blog, we are going to list out 5 reasons why students choose coworking spaces. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Flexibility </strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the best things about coworking space is that it provides students with so much flexibility. Most of the coworking spaces are open 24/7 which provides the students with the flexibility to work during the late hours, early in the morning or just for long stretches of time. Propques also allows students to opt for an hourly or daily subscription if they do not want to pay for a monthly plan.  </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to a survey, more than 76% of people who work from a <strong><a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coworking space</a></strong> have admitted an increase in their productivity. While using a coworking space, students can focus on their work without any interruptions. It forces them to stick to a more efficient work schedule thus, allowing them to do more work which in turn increases their productivity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Networking</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are endless opportunities for networking in a coworking space. When you step through the doors of a coworking space, you are met with dozens of people from different professions. As a student, you can get a chance to interact with them and learn from the business people themselves. You can learn things that you may never have otherwise considered.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Resources</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The general stereotype of a coworking space is that it’s a fun place where people can work as well as enjoy themselves at the same time. Most of the coworking spaces provide with loads of benefits and resources like:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></ul>

<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li> Game Area</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Social Events</li>

<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Snacks/meals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These facilities attract a lot of young entrepreneurs and students and the good thing is that they are included in the subscription costs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Preparation For The Future</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While working from a coworking space, students can learn so much from the people who are already working in the industry. Many statistics show that the traditional office setting is becoming obsolete and that shared workspace will be the office of the future. By choosing a coworking space students can prepare themselves for the collaborative office space they may find themselves in when they enter the real job world.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The benefits of using a coworking space are becoming well-known among youths like students and young entrepreneurs. Students are in love with the idea of working in a shared space and the opportunities that come with it. After the pandemic, as more students choose to work online, the demand for a shared workspace where individuals can meet their colleagues and work together will only increase.</p>

<p>Are Your Coworking Members Happy? The answer to this question alone is enough to predict the future of your <a href="https://www.propques.com/start-coworking-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="coworking business (opens in a new tab)"><strong>coworking business</strong></a>. As a coworking manager, you must understand that establishing a shared office location and filling it with clients is half the battle won for a coworking space. However, it does not guarantee long-term success.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To ensure a profitable and thriving business, you must invest your time and resources to turn your members into happy and loyal customers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this blog, we will list out the Top 3 ways with which you can keep your coworking members happy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h2><strong>Focus on the Basics</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Comfort &amp; productivity, social &amp; professional network and flexibility are some basic set of needs that a coworking space must provide to satisfy its members:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The resources invested by a coworking manager must focus equally on these basic needs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Comfort and productivity go hand in hand, therefore, ensuring that resources like fully furnished spaces, High-speed Wifi/Internet connection, climate control systems, etc are available to the members would help increase productivity and comfort of your members. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>A unique feature that helps <strong><a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="coworking spaces (opens in a new tab)">coworking spaces</a></strong> stand out against traditional offices is the ability to help its members socialise and network with like-minded people from different professions. Having quality members helps boost this base need for a coworking space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Coworking spaces must be designed to provide flexibility to its members. Amenities like 24/7 access, month-to-month terms, etc. should help you to make your coworking space more flexible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h2><strong>Promise what you can Deliver </strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To lure more members, many coworking spaces promise special perks like community events, happy hours, complimentary snacks, etc. which they fail to deliver later-on. This is one of the common reasons as to why members leave a coworking space. Over-promising can also have a huge negative impact on the brand-value of coworking space. Therefore,  landlords/service providers must be transparent about their services from the beginning itself.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At Propques, we believe in absolute transparency between members and coworking space providers. Why? Because without transparency members struggle to build meaningful relationships with the coworking service providers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We have a panel of experts that checks the transparency and authenticity of a coworking space. This helps us to connect a coworking space user with the best coworking space available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h2><strong>Stay in touch with your Members and ask for Regular Feedback</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ensure that your coworking space manager directly interacts with all the members of your coworking community. Daily communication can increase a sense of belonging among your members. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some common activities like:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Introducing new members to other members </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Rewarding members for their accomplishments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Loyalty programs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>can greatly boost their morale. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Getting direct user feedback is also very important for your coworking business. It will help you know about your shortcomings and how to improve them. Here are some quick ways to get valuable feedback from your members:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Approach them directly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Install a suggestion-box</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Many customers don’t feel like filling out long, tedious surveys so try asking them for their opinion in a more casual setting. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Try to make some easy suggested changes, like more snack items or weekly community events right away to assure your members that you are serious about their feedback. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Quality in a service or product is not what you put into it. It is what the customer gets out of it. Making a customer happy is not an easy task but if you can focus on these basic steps mentioned above then your coworking brand will definitely outperform many of its competitors. </p>

<p>A co-working not only sells spaces to a client, but it also transforms a space to perfectly suit their needs. A co-working <strong><em>community manager</em></strong> helps prolifically in that, as he is the face of the co-working. He also deals with multiple tasks throughout his working day, which ensures smooth operations of a co-working.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Why do we need a community manager? </strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Someone has to keep things right in a co-working; someone has to maintain the operational discipline at the place; someone has to take care of the members at a co-working. Has to make sure all the services are up to the mark, failing which, the chances are high that a co-working fails miserably to deliver to its members, and comes out as a big disappointment for the owner and clients. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A <strong><em>community manager</em></strong> takes care of the daily operations of a co-working and is also responsible for connecting members, serving them efficiently, and attracting potential clients to it. He looks after the marketing activities of the co-working and is answerable for the implementation of regular marketing activities. He serves as a common link between the various departments and helps in building a more efficient operations team. As he is much closer to co-workers than other staff, he comes up with valuable inputs for every user-related activity.   </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>The confusion about the necessity of a community manager!</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":25}}} --></p>
<p style="font-size: 25px;"> </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, there is common disorientation regarding them in a flexible workplace. Which is, what community managers do the whole day? Are we going to need them from the start of operations? Are they doing their work efficiently? Or can we assign some more responsibilities to them? </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This confusion is avoidable only if we know their role in co-working. And also understand the responsibilities or tasks they have to do generally on a working day. Only then estimating whether a <strong><em>community manager</em></strong> is up to the mark is possible. And, this will also help us figure out whether we can assign some more tasks to them without hurting their role. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Daily tasks of a community manager</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When talking about what consumes the most of the daily time of a <strong><em>community manager</em></strong>, we can list out some responsibilities or tasks.</p>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>A <strong><em>community manager</em></strong> is responsible for maintain safety and hygiene at the place. Generally, twice a day, but, as late-night meets may have created some mess, it’s his responsibility to look after cleanliness and hygiene to welcome the members in the morning, with a fresher work environment. In the wake of the current situation of COVID-19, hygiene and safety have become paramount.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mail management is another aspect under his supervision; he is accountable for communication going internally and externally. He has to look after that all members are informed of any notice by mail or print communication. Also, he is the link between the external sources and the core staff. </li>
</ul>

<li>Member management is also a crucial part of his job routine. He has to look after the registration and allocation of new members.

<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Apart from these, some more tasks add to the profile of the <strong><em>community manager</em></strong> list like greeting guests, chat with members, posting photos and videos, analyzing data, preparing charts, etc. Also, the intensity and count of his responsibilities depend on a particular workplace.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Bottom line</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A <strong><em>community manager</em></strong> is a bridge between the co-working members and the staff, as he understands the requirements and queries of the members and staff. He is in continuous touch with the members and knows the methods to communicate efficiently with them. With the services he provides, a <strong><em>community manager</em></strong> adds intangible value to a co-working, resulting in uplifting the price value of the services by a co-working.</p>

<p>In the span of just a year, the global pandemic has accelerated innovation, and with it, coworking trends, in commercial real estate. An otherwise steadfast industry, the remote work revolution has uprooted previous assumptions about office space and heralded in a new future of work. Landlords are facing a new reality: traditional office space could become obsolete. To future-proof their portfolios, astute building owners are turning to coworking as an answer, and many are launching their own coworking and flexible office spaces. Why are some building owners choosing to go it alone?<strong>&nbsp;A surge in coworking&nbsp;closure, changing demand, and increasingly available management resources and expertise have created a favorable climate for innovative landlords to take the reigns and create their own coworking offerings.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Coworking Trends:&nbsp;Aligning Owner and Tenant Needs</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As the pandemic tests the future of the office, “the end of office” is unlikely. Many companies don’t plan on making remote work permanent. Instead, a new movement around flexibility is emerging, which will rethink how the office is going to be&nbsp;<em>utilized</em>&nbsp;when employees return. Companies like Facebook and Microsoft aren’t abandoning physical space. They are simply reevaluating the role of office as an employee benefit, in order to:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --><p></p>
<li>Promote a dynamic company culture</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Sustain long-term employee and company growth</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Drive talent recruitment, connectivity, and retention</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This changing role of office necessitates a realignment between landlords and tenants. Companies are increasingly focused beyond square footages, on the&nbsp;<em>performance</em>&nbsp;of office space. Building owners will need to rethink and differentiate their commercial real estate as a product to deliver the best building experience and delight their tenants. A better offering will lead to better outcomes for landlords to:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --><p></p>
<li>Sustain steady, predictable rent payments</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Attract and retain tenants</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Minimize TI spend</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Avoid defaults</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A coworking offering presents one key differentiator, or tool, in the landlord toolbox. Previously, many landlords have partnered with third-party providers to offer tenants flexible space. However, as coworking operators increasingly move toward management agreements and take on less risk, they’re no longer signing traditional leases. Coupled with hundreds of operator closures, landlords are now left to figure out what to do with vacant flex space, and many are making the decision to launch their own.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>The Top Reasons Why Building Owners Decided to Run Their Own Coworking Spaces</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As the flexible space market matures, the economics between owners and coworking operators are changing. Initially, the long-term lease model of WeWork and others helped to reduce vacancies and propelled rents higher. This first wave of coworking was comfortable for owners, with traditional agreements over 10+ year periods. In essence, coworking tenants were similar to other office tenants. However, when operators began giving back space in low-performing markets, financial stresses exposed vulnerabilities in operator business models, who depended on short-term customers to fill long-term commitments (disconnect!). Now, a combination of opportunity and evolving coworking trends are leading building owners to consider running their own coworking and flexible office spaces. The entire commercial real estate industry is undergoing a mind-shift in the way customers are treated.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>An Opportunity to Better Service Existing Tenants</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Happy tenants drive profit. Tenant retention is one of the most cost-effective strategies building owners can employ, as turnover is costly. To combat churn, building owners are focused on providing an excellent tenant experience.&nbsp;Reports that 80% of satisfied tenants are strongly likely to renew leases, as compared to 100% of tenants who will not renew due to poor experience. What drives satisfaction? Current tenants need flexibility. Rather than having them leave the building, building owners are listening to coworking trends and considering providing flexible office space in-house</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Access to Smaller, Dynamic Tenants</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Running a coworking space in your building provides access to a whole new tenant market. The flexibility, low capital outlay, and low-risk commitments attract a different type of tenant: the fast-growing startup. This kind of offering can act as an incubator, with the potential to help tenants move further into the building, and eventually sign larger leases as their companies grow. Bonus? Small teams aren’t the only demographic in need of flexible space. By 2020, enterprise companies represented at least 40% of WeWork’s business. Large corporations need flexible space to manage headcount uncertainty, or to establish spokes in a hub-and-spoke model. By offering a coworking component within the building, landlords open the doors to another type of income stream, with high potential for growth.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Fewer Fees, More Upside</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As operators move increasingly toward management agreements, landlords are stuck taking on more risk while still paying high fees. The fees that coworking operators are charging are often more than building owners want to pay. The higher risk associated with these kinds of agreements, coupled with recent headlines around coworking closures, are making landlords more reluctant to turn spaces over to operators. This has accelerated coworking trends towards landlord-operators. Building owners like the Blackstone Group, which manages Willis Tower through EQ Office, have openly spoken about partnering with operators like Industrious to learn, in order to be able to launch their own offering in the long-run. Now, the pandemic may abbreviate these kinds of timelines moving forward.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>What Coworking Trends are Enabling Landlords to Pivot Now?</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the pandemic is accelerating decision-making around the future of office, and necessitating landlords to rethink their strategies, a number of other coworking trends are working behind the scenes to enable this transition to owner-operator.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Readily-Available Tech Stack</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the early days of coworking, big operators like Regus and WeWork developed their own technology stacks to streamline their coworking operations. Today, the tech stack required to manage a coworking space is readily available on the market. The list of readily-available coworking space tech, from coworking space management software, to access control, IoT, high-speed WiFi, and visitor management, is getting longer and longer. CRETech is comprised of over 4,000 startups, with more than $12.9 billion invested in 2019 alone. Landlords can now select best-of-breed, scalable, and cost-effective software suites to manage their own coworking offering without having to hire expensive developers. Having this technology not only streamlines day-to-day management, but also unlocks unprecedented access and insights into the tenants that occupy your spaces. Landlords, enabled by technology, have the power to deliver exceptional tenant experiences for occupants, while maximizing efficiency and profitability.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Rising Vacancies</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Real estate experts have estimated that as many as 1 in 5 India coworking locations, totaling an estimated 2 Lakh square feet, will close or change hands as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. An&nbsp;Propques found that over 400 locations, 20,000 seats closed in 2020, which represents a reduction in just under 6% of the 4000 locations that Propques tracks. Since then, these coworking trends continue, with Breather having closed its 400+ locations. For building owners, closures represent vacant space within their buildings, and they are faced with 2 options: find a long-term tenant, or take over management. Plagued with low occupancy, sublease, and now returned space from operators, many building owners are considering coworking or flexible office as a way forward to monetize the available space.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Strong Talent Pool</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>No coworking space will run itself, no matter how good the tech stack. The second key ingredient to operating your own coworking space is to hire experienced talent. Fortunately for owners, the pool has widened significantly in the last year, following thousands of layoffs from WeWork, EC and Regus, ETC. While some owners are learning from their operator partners, others have the opportunity to simply hire those their partners have trained for years. Companies like CBRE have already used this strategy, leaning on ex-WeWork talent to launch their own coworking brands. In the words of Malcolm Glazer, owner of the Buccaneers, “if you want to know the road ahead, ask the person who’s been there.” In other words, find and hire your Tom Brady.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>The Types of Landlords Considering Their Own Coworking Spaces</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p>Innovative, bigger landlords (and real estate services firms) are well-equipped to reinvent a better product, whether from scratch or through the acquisition of an already-established coworking brand. Landlords with larger portfolios can benefit from the scale that existing CRETech stacks unlock to operate their own offerings. Early adoption can serve to differentiate their brand as an innovator and thought-leader in the space. The offering will also serve to differentiate their building, whether from the rest of the block, or regionally as a desirable offering for high-growth tenants. It is worth mentioning that coworking is not the only type of flexible office that owners are poised to offer; many building owners already command executive and spec suites, as well as other types of spaces that can be activated with this model. Many are already making plans.</p>

<p>You need a sales funnel system and you have to work extra hard during your launch stage to get leads into the top of your funnel. We’re going to go through each layer of the funnel in detail, but let’s start here…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An overview of the coworking sales funnel</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Starting at the top, we have leads that come from a variety of sources. Where do we want those leads to go? To your website to book a tour.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Your ultimate goal is to convert them into a recurring member.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Once you get the lead into your space, you want to match their needs to their intangible goals of community, productivity, sense of belonging, etc. You want to match their tangible physical space needs to the  inventory available in our space.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong><em>Your ultimate goal is to convert them into a recurring member.</em></strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>If they don’t convert on-site, then they are classified as a warm lead that we nurture through our tour follow-up sequence. The funnel is fairly simple and there are a number of levers to pull to drive more conversion at each stage. The critical path to success is constant focus on getting leads into the top of the funnel and improving each step along the way.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>let’s talk through each layer of the coworking sales funnel in detail</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Let’s start at the bottom of our funnel because this is the end goal and drives how we approach the higher levels of the funnel. You should determine your own end goal and adjust your sales funnel accordingly. If you need help with this, see my post on “How big should my coworking space be?”</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>1. THE BOTTOM OF THE SALES FUNNEL – THE END GOAL. START WITH THE END IN MIND.</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>In the definition of sales funnel that we are using in this article, we are focusing on a goal of building a recurring membership base that creates a certain net income at the end of a 12 month period. There are a lot of non-financial goals and outcomes around starting a coworking space such as building community, helping businesses to grow, economic development, creating an on-site amenity that grows revenue for the rest of your real estate portfolio, and so on, but this particular discussion is around the net income number.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Do we have the right size of space and product mix to make this happen?”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>So let’s start with that number. For easy math, let’s say it’s INR1000000 per month. Assuming your margin is 25%, that means you need to make INR1225000 per month in revenue.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>So, how do we do that?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Let’s back into it.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First, do we have the right size of space and product mix to make this happen? This is critical.This is a helpful exercise to do before you sign a lease. If you already have a space, this will be a good reality check to understand your profit potential.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, you need to make INR1225000 per month in revenue. Pull out your pro-forma. Make sure your revenue potential matches your goal. Do you have the right amount of inventory of offices, dedicated desks, flex seating, meeting rooms, event space and other revenue-generating spaces and opportunities like virtual mail, to make this happen?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you have not done a pro-forma yet, the very simple explanation on how to do this is to take the number of each product type and multiply it by the sales price and add it all up.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you’ve determined it is indeed INR1225000per month, great. If not, let’s update our revenue goal to match our inventory. One note here &#8211; when doing this exercise before you open, I would be conservative and not assume you are going to over-sell flex-seating or hit the lottery with virtual mail members until you prove that you can. Let these two opportunities provide upside vs. a potential disappointment to your financials.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Can you fix your product mix and get a payback on that change before your lease runs out?”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>2. THE TOP OF YOUR COWORKING SALES FUNNEL – GETTING RELEVANT VISITORS TO YOUR WEBSITE</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>If you have the product mix that you believe is in demand in your market, your next step is to sell it! You need to get people into your space. Now we’re really back to the “If you build it they will come” fallacy. “They” defined as people actively searching for workspace, will come if you show up in their search.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>f you are in a small market, with only 1 or 2 other coworking spaces, then you might just get lucky and show up in the first few search results on the Google search results page without doing much work. However, If you are in a market with competition, then you are fighting your way to the top from the bottom!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are two ways to show up toward the top of the Google Search Results page.</p>

<h2>HERE’S WHAT THAT CONTENT MARKETING FOR A COWORKING SPACE MIGHT LOOK LIKE:</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Post 2-4 blog posts with relevant keywords each month. For content marketing support specific to the coworking industry, Cat Johnson is my go-to resource. Her website is Catjohnson.co. Spending your time writing blog posts is not “free” per say, but it will reduce your spend on marketing over time. You will need to write these posts or hire a writer. Time is not free therefore this is not free but the expense of a writer is relatively low and this is an investment in your search results ranking future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Actively promote your content on social media and via email marketing so that you drive visits to your blog posts which signals to Google that you have relevant content (the next step of course is to have good content that people actually read so that Google continues to rank you for this article).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Complete your Google My Business Listing and update it regularly with reviews, photos and offers. As I mentioned repeatedly on the podcast, my GMB listing gets 20x the traffic that my website gets, likely because so many users are searching via mobile. Your GMB listing is free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Try to get backlinks. Another key measure that Google uses to determine your ranking is how many other sites link to you. This can be challenging for a new site. Getting backlinks will require some hustle and bartering. Local press, coworking directories, etc, will help build authority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A great resource for SEO in general is <a href="https://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEM Rush</a> and a book from Andy Crestodina called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Content-Chemistry-Illustrated-Handbook-Marketing/dp/0988336464#customerReviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Content Marketing Chemistry</a> (it’s not super long and it’s very approachable).</p>

<p><strong>SEO takes a good 6 months to start kicking in and moving you up the search result page&#8230; and remember, you’re competing with your neighboring spaces for who is willing to be the most consistent on these fronts. Hard work and consistency pay off over time with SEO.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While you’re putting in your SEO work and waiting for that to start humming, you have memberships to sell and you’ll want to pay Google to get a good spot on that search results page. Find a reputable Google Adwords professional to get you started. Warning &#8211; if you are in a top tier city, this might be an expensive endeavor. You will want a professional that can help you determine if you can afford to compete with entrenched competitors with large budgets. That being said, if people are paying for keywords, that generally means there’s a ROI for them. If AdWords is out of reach, then consider FaceBook Ads and or whatever search apps are most popular in your local area.</p>

<p>Determining how to optimize the INR you spend and the time you spend getting the most relevant traffic to your website will take time — you will need to test, assess, tweak and repeat. But this is important work because you need a certain amount of traffic in the top of your funnel to get to your goal net income at the bottom of the funnel. More on that math coming soon.</p>

<p><em>Note: I sometimes see posts in the @propques post or asked in my groups from people that seem a little frantic over filling their space and they are looking for a marketing “silver bullet.” There are no “get rich quick” tricks in filling a coworking space. For a 10,000 to 20,000 square foot space, it may take you 18 months to ramp up to a stabilized occupancy rate of 90-95%. Plan for this and along the way, be brutally consistent with your marketing tactics. Treat these activities as if your business depends on them. Because it does. You won’t see results in a big bang – you will see results, slowly over time as your sales funnel gains traction.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now that you have some consistent activities in place to drive traffic to your website, which is the top of your funnel, let’s move a step down in the coworking sales funnel.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Converting website visitors to scheduling a tour</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Now your goal is to convert a percentage of your website visitors into tours because you and I know that once you get them in the door, to know you is to love you.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let’s take a moment to talk about math. There might be 500,000 people in your metro area. Some small percentage of this group is a) in your geographic target market and b) actively looking for a workspace at any given time. So when you’re thinking about your “market size,” make sure to whittle it down to the population of self-employed/business owners/remote corporate employees within, say, a 5-mile radius of your space… So that might get the number down to say, 20,000. And then what percentage of that group is actively looking for space at any given point in time? 1%? What’s 1% of 20,000? 200. When they come to your website, you need to suck them in! Magnetize them, and give them what they want immediately! An address, membership options, pricing, a sense of what your space offers in terms of vibe and culture. You have a lot of work to do in the few seconds that the visitor will spend assessing whether or not you can solve their problem.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your website might have thousands of visitors per month that don’t fit into your target market. So when you’re looking at your conversion number which is calculated by dividing number of tours booked by number of website visitors, that number will typically be very small. Which is why you must do everything you can at this level of the funnel to avoid LEAKAGE.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What is leakage, you are wondering? Leakage happens when you have a website visitor whose problem you CAN solve but leaves your website without booking a tour because you made it too hard. Your users are busy, impatient, distracted and did I mention impatient?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Here’s an example:</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h3>Mahima In Indore</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Mahima started a marketing consulting firm. She has been working from home but she’s about to hire a new team member and doesn’t want to have team meetings at her kitchen table. So she’s ready to build an office into her budget and kind of excited about getting out of her house, having a routine, meeting new people and making friends. She’s ready to find her tribe. She Googles for coworking spaces in Indore and finds five that are within her preferred commute time of 20 minutes and decides to peruse their websites, book tours for Wednesday to tour them and then she’ll do trial days at 2-3 of them.  </strong></p>

<p>Mahima starts diving into websites. She has about a half hour to look through all of them because she has client calls all day and deadlines she needs to hit for them. She wants to find the right space but can’t spend a lot of time on it. She could have her assistant do the research for her, but she really wants to get a sense of the vibe of the space before she wastes time touring.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first website she finds is yours (wahoo!!) because you’ve done all the right things…. Google ad, Google My Business listing, content marketing, active social media accounts. You’re in the top three results on the search results page. Your Google reviews are very positive and you have 2-3 from each month that you’ve been open.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>She starts scanning your homepage…. She loves the images of people in your space that she feels like she can relate to. She scans your membership packages – those look good. Then she tries to figure out exactly where you are located and can’t find your address anywhere on the home page. She is starting to get impatient because she has four more spaces to research before her next client call but she sticks with you and clicks on your “contact us” page where she finally finds your address with an accompanying map of the area.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>She makes a few notes and thinks she’ll probably come back and schedule a tour.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>She quickly moves through the other websites, makes notes and narrows her list to the three she wants to tour. She wants to do all of the tours on Wednesday and make a decision. She goes back to your website to book a tour</p>

<p>The other websites supported online booking – she could just click a button and choose a time to come in for a tour that worked for her. Super easy. Yours however, doesn’t have that – it has a contact form so she has to fill in several fields and request a tour time and wait for you to respond. There’s no phone number for her to call and ask. She likes your space but is feeling frustrated that it’s not as user-friendly as the others so decides to tour the other two spaces first and then if she doesn’t love them, she’ll add yours to the list.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>She tours the other two spaces, one of them seems to fit the bill and she chooses that one. You lose Mahima.</p>

In today’s day and age where you can book a restaurant reservation with a swipe of your finger, rent a house with a click of a mouse and ask google to get you an uber, you’d better make it as easy as possible for your potential customers to book a tour on your site. Having to fill in a contact form and play email tag will lose anyone that doesn’t have some specific reason to need to be in your space (i.e., it’s the closest to home).</li>

<h2>BEFORE THE TOUR</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Getting a prospective member on-site for a tour is another critical point in the sales funnel and now the prospect is yours to lose. Ensure that you have a clear tour-day process documented and that your staff is trained to manage and execute the process.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>SEVEN TOUR-DAY CONSIDERATIONS:</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol><!-- wp:list-item --></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Is the member set up to get into your space with no frustration? Do they know where to park (if relevant) and how to access the door of your space? Is your entrance clearly marked with directional signage (as much as possible depending on your building rules)?</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>How is the member greeted when they enter the space? Will your community manager or sales manager be able to ensure that he/she is at the front desk when your tour arrives? If not, how can you make sure that he/she is?</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Has your tour guide researched the prospective member so that she can immediately ask relevant questions and create common ground? A simple LinkedIn search will often yield enough information to make some connections &#8211; previous jobs, mutual connections, educational background, where the person has lived, etc. Consider having your staff add any relevant LinkedIn notes to the prospective members’ entry in your CRM.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Does your tour guide have a prescribed path through the space as well as a discussion flow with key talking points to go through with the prospective member? In my experience, this is critical. In no organization should sales staff go untrained. Most people are not 100% “natural” at selling. You may not like to think of this process as selling &#8211; you may prefer to think of it as attracting the right members to your space. It’s OK to frame the process as something other than “sales,” however, I recommend you still approach it as a sales process in order to optimize conversions to get to that end goal of financial sustainability.</strong></li>

</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>What “special sauce” tactics do you integrate into your tour process? Does the prospective member get introduced to a current member? Is the prospective member invited to attend a member event? To stay for the day to work?</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the process for your staff to get to know the prospective member throughout the tour? A list of questions? A brief sit-down with them in a meeting room before the tour starts?</strong></li>

<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<ol>

<p>As your tour guide wraps up the tour, he/she should let the prospective member know that you’ll send them a follow-up email including pricing and membership details. Mention this at the beginning of the tour so they know they don’t have to take notes on those items during the tour, and then at the end, which sets an expectation that you will follow up with them via email, but in a way that is helpful to them.</p>

<h2>THE TOUR FOLLOW-UP</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>If your prospective member has left the space without signing up on-site, the next best outcome is that they’ve agreed to sign up when they get home. If this is the case, send them, the next action they need to take immediately. “Time kills deals” is my favorite quote from a sales guy I used to work with. It’s true. People get distracted, change their mind about their budget, get busy with work projects and push off the decision, etc. If they’ve said they’re ready, send your sign-up links immediately and get that member signed up!</strong></p>

<p>It goes without saying that the global pandemic has been an extremely challenging period for coworking spaces all over the world. With millions of people forced to stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus and offices closing their doors, many coworking spaces have been forced to pause their operations too. But thanks to developments in COVID treatments, now finally in sight — which means that this difficult time for work spaces may soon be over.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Given this, it’s time to start thinking about how to bring people — both old and new — back to your coworking space. To help you get started, we’ve prepared four tips that’ll help get your establishment back on track.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h2>Prioritize Health and Safety</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the pandemic remains (and even after it’s over), you have to do your best to protect the health and safety of everyone in your coworking space. Having good health protocols will be a huge draw for many customers, especially with many people still wary about going out.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So how do you go about doing this? Aside from regularly cleaning and enforcing social distancing in your space, having contactless transactions is important in boosting customer confidence and keeping your own team safe too.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h2>Offer A Free Trial</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One great way to bring in new people is to let them try your space out for free. And while this may seem like an unnecessary cost at the start, it could prove to be quite beneficial for your coworking space in the long run. By offering a free trial, you’re tapping into a certain group of people that are less likely to avail of your services on their own accord.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h2>Make Use of Ergonomic Office Equipment</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant effect that the pandemic had on workplaces is triggering the abrupt shift to remote work. But while remote working has allowed companies to stay afloat and continue their operations, it isn’t exactly the best method of work for all professionals. Unfortunately, <a href="https://themanifest.com/hr/productivity-tips-working-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a survey on The Manifes</a>t reveals that only 30% of workers are more productive at home.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Indeed, not having access to proper equipment and conducive rooms are huge factors to efficiency and productivity. As such, you can attract customers by providing what their home offices cannot, such as ergonomic office equipment. <a href="https://www.painfreeworking.com/best-ergonomic-chairs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pain Free Working’s article on the best ergonomic chairs</a> states that proper ergonomics is an absolute necessity if you’re looking to improve the overall wellbeing of workers. After all, it helps them perform their jobs comfortably without putting a strain on their bodies — especially after all those months of putting up with their dining tables and couches at home.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h2>Create a Referral Program</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The global pandemic has reminded us of the importance of having a community. Having a healthy and positive community is a huge factor when it came to retaining members. This is why it isn’t at all surprising to know that you can once again lean on your coworking space community to attract new members.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A referral program can help bring in a lot of new people. All you have to do is come up with a rewards system (maybe in the form of a discount) for your current members who bring a new person into the coworking space. This can be pretty effective since people tend to trust the opinions and recommendations of people within their own circles.</p>

<p>India, like most of the country, is starting to emerge from the COVID lockdown. You and thousands of others were suddenly forced to work from home, and you’re probably getting tired of it. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">coworking</a>&nbsp;world is taking extra physical distancing precautions so remote workers and freelancers can safely cowork. The friendly hello in the morning to another actual real-life person, pouring a fresh pot of locally crafted coffee, and a simple walk to an office can be a blessing that we took for granted. If you are ready to get out of the house and start working from a coworking space, here a few things to consider.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What makes a coworking space great for remote workers</h3>



<p><strong>Extra Monitors are a Must</strong></p>



<p>At your regular office and at your home office you probably have a second external monitor. If not, you should. Extra monitors have proven to make people more productive and they help keep your back and neck in an ergonomic position. External monitors are good for your work flow and good for you health.</p>



<p><strong>Phone Booths for Conference Calls</strong></p>



<p>Now that the entire team is working remotely, you are probably on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Zoom calls for several hours a day.&nbsp;</a>A coworking space that is designed for remote workers should phone booths and meetings rooms for people to talk freely in on a confereence call. You should still have headphones on when in the phone booth, they usually aren’t soundproof so it’s a nice courtesy to your neighbors.</p>



<p><strong>24/7 Availability for Wokrers</strong></p>



<p>You are probably like most remote workers in Indian Cities and you work in a different time zone.This means that you usually start your day early or later than your local go-to-the-office friends. Coworking speaces should have flexible office hours and not force people to work a 9 to 7 workday. One of the most beautiful things about working remote is flexibility.</p>



<p><strong>A Friendly and Smart Community</strong></p>



<p>You don’t want to work to work in uncomfortable silience with uninterested people. You want to get out of the house and be with friends, have interesting conversations, and be able to ask for help if you run into a problem. Ya know, just like a normal office. Your new coworking space should have a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">strong community and a culture</a>&nbsp;of openness that makes you feel welcome. This is difficult to judge from a tour or just one day, but it’s going to be the most important thing.</p>



<p><strong>No Hidden Fees or Complicated Contracts</strong></p>



<p>A coworking plan for remote workers should be as simple as signing up for Netflix. A coworking space should not have a long complicated contract with hidden fees for kitchen access, coffee, or move out fees. It should be straightforward and simple.</p>



<p>If you follow these guidelines on finding your new coworking space, then you are well on your way to getting out of your house and becoming a happy remote worker again.</p>

<p>The research into the effects of color on psychology is not extensive or indeed conclusive, though there are many theories that have infiltrated common design practice according to their emotional properties and symbolism. Naturally, depending on the tint or shade &#8211; and indeed the personality &#8211; these psychological responses are heightened or muted. But here are the most common associations of the primary and secondary colors, and where and why you should use them.</p>



<p><strong>Red</strong>&nbsp;is associated with energy and intensity. It is the color the eye notices first in the color wheel: it seems to jump out at us. For this reason, red makes time appear to pass slower since we are highly aware of our environment. It is also physical stimulant, increasing pulse rate and adrenaline. Moreover, some studies suggest that red impairs performance. For these reasons, avoid overusing primary reds in work areas, as it can be oppressive and disquieting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red can however help add warmth to a room and give it depth, for example with a feature wall or soft furnishings. When using red as a highlight, however, ensure that attention to detail is paid: since it the the color the eye is drawn to first, any flaws in paintwork or upholstery will stick out like a sore thumb.</p>



<p>When using red, it should be reserved it for large open areas only, and used sparingly. Aim for burgundies or muted reds, like the color of brick.&nbsp;Red is a suitable color for kitchens and dining areas, as it is an appetite stimulant &#8211; consider fast food logos, most of which include red.</p>



<p>While still promoting excitement and vibrancy,orangeis less shocking than red, and can be used more liberally in a workspace without overbearing the senses. Orange is a good color to use if your space is feeling lackluster, as it uplifts and energizes.</p>



<p><strong>Blue</strong>&nbsp;is at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum than red. People are said to be more productive in blue rooms, though it is not a color that inspires excitement or creativity, and can make a room feel cold and uninviting.</p>



<p>In addition, blues, along with grays, are common hues used to decorate traditional offices. Typically, this is the image coworking spaces try to avoid. If using blue in a workspace, consider using a complementary color scheme and break it up with warmer tones.&nbsp;Avoid using blue in the kitchen and dining areas because it is an appetite suppressant; the rarity of blue-colored foods in nature reflects this.</p>



<p><strong>Green</strong>&nbsp;is the color of nature and is said to calm and relax. It also relieves tired eyes, and a pale tint especially improves reading ability, so is a good choice for all sized workspaces. Green is associated with eco-friendly products.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Brown</strong>&nbsp;is the second color associated with nature. It inspires feelings of trust and fidelity, and makes a space feel comfortable and inviting. For this reason, having brown upholstery, a chocolate colored wall, or wooden furniture can be a good addition to a meeting room. Using raw wood in a large, open workspace is an easy way to create a feeling of comfort.</p>



<p>White&nbsp;invokes a sense of spaciousness. It is neutral, so goes with most things, though if not broken up with other colors, can be sterile and bland. Apart from walls, using white to furnish requires time and money, since it dirties quickly, especially in a high-traffic environment like a coworking space. In some cultures white is the color of mourning.</p>



<p>There is often a compulsion to try to make small, darker spaces appear larger by painting them&nbsp;<strong>white</strong>. An alternative is to embrace their qualities, and use these rooms to create cozy, warm and inviting atmospheres. Use browns, burgundies and bronzes to create a sophisticated and comfortable spaces, perfect for informal meeting rooms or chill-out areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the color&nbsp;<strong>yellow</strong>&nbsp;in the western world is considered happy, it actually increases impatience and irrationality. Yellow is also the most difficult color to look at and causes strain to the eyes. Avoid overusing yellow in a workspace for this reason. Golds, on the other hand, are easier on the eye, and are a good way to add an element of finesse and luxury to a workspace without spending big. Think cornices and skirting boards.</p>



<p>Black&nbsp;absorbs all light in the color spectrum, so avoid using blocks of black which can be oppressive. It is also used for mourning in Western cultures, so can drain positivity from a space. On the other hand, black is considered a technical color, and so can be a good choice for hackerspaces and tech-oriented coworking spaces. It also denotes power and control. A few black cushions can give your space a strong and empowered feeling.</p>



<p>Pale&nbsp;purples,&nbsp;like lavenders and lilacs, are calming and relaxing, and do not promote enthusiasm or creativity, so should be avoided in areas dedicated to work. Royal purple, however, symbolises royalty (no surprises there) and wealth. As it is rarely found in nature and can appear artificial.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that up until the mid-20th century&nbsp;pink&nbsp;&#8211; as it is a tint of red &#8211; was a masculine color, modern associations link it to femininity. Pink is believed to have a calming effect, and many refer to the instance of pink-painted prison cells reducing aggression of inmates. This belief is contested, but given its association with femininity, it does not lend itself to a coworking space’s décor.</p>



<p><em>Whatever colors you choose</em></p>



<p>Decorate your space from light to dark, vertically &#8211; like in nature. A ceiling that is darker than the floor creates uneasiness and is inharmonious.</p>



<p>If you have a statement piece of furniture or a sizeable work of art that you know will adorn your space, consider these when picking color schemes and soft furnishings. Take our colors from the piece, or use complementary colors to accentuate it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.propques.com/start-coworking-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Existing interior features</em></a></p>



<p>Work with the existing interior, and highlight interesting features. Much like artwork, columns, external gas and water pipes and stucco are interesting to look at and give a room texture. Use contrasting colors to highlight them, or paint them to help pick up other features in the room. These features are good ways to add warm hues &#8211; reds, oranges, and yellows &#8211; to a room without being over the top.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.propques.com/start-coworking-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Temperature control</em></a></p>



<p>If your space has an abundance of natural afternoon sunlight, including orange in your color scheme is probably not a good move. Likewise, a dark room shouldn’t be painted blue. Colors change the perception of temperature, and so to&nbsp;help reduce the amount spent on air conditioning and heating, use certain color schemes to create a feeling of warmth or coolness.</p>

<p>Put thought into your WCs. Coworkers will appreciate a well-kept and attractive bathroom, both for themselves and any clients they receive. Feature walls in patterned wallpaper or bold colors can work well in these areas.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.propques.com/start-coworking-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Façade</em></a></p>



<p>Decorating doesn’t stop inside &#8211; don’t forget about your building’s façade: it’s the first impression that anyone has of your space. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean a paint job. There are many creative ways to create a block of color on a façade.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.propques.com/start-coworking-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paying attention to décor is of the utmost importance for a coworking space.</a>&nbsp;The more comfortable and relaxed, yet motivated and enthusiastic they feel, the more likely they are to spend time in a space.</p>
