<p>The concept of working from virtual offices has become the new normal. The setup is digitized so that one can work from absolutely anywhere while projecting a professional view. This trend challenges the coworking industry in spaces known as &#8220;the communal work hubs where people and small businesses come together,&#8221; as the dictionary defines them. Look at how virtual offices are damaging coworking spaces and how they can be mitigated.</p>



<p><strong>The Decline in Membership: Empty Desks and Diminishing Foot Traffic</strong></p>



<p>Many coworking spaces are losing memberships as the pool of<a href="/"> virtual offices</a> grows and becomes a rising trend.</p>



<p>People are going contemporary, finding it more comfortable to work from wherever they are and prefer to avoid signing up for a physical office. This leaves many coworking spaces with empty desks, low foot traffic, and non-vibrancy.</p>



<p><strong>Disruption in the Coworking Landscape: Shifting Demands and Expectations</strong></p>



<p>With its members&#8217; changing needs and expectations, coworking spaces still have to align themselves with the new norm of a virtual office. This attractiveness of remote work is forcing rethinking among most people and companies about the need for physical office spaces, and the trend has resulted in falling numbers of members at traditional coworking spaces.</p>



<p>That will make hybrid work models, which meld full-time and part-time remote and in-person collaboration for coworking spaces, all the more confusing.</p>



<p><strong>Competition for Clients: Losing the Battle for Business</strong></p>



<p>Virtual offices have made the competition tough for coworking spaces to attract customers. This has now become a phenomenon that benefits businesses and freelancers not attached to a location. It has increased the scramble of the coworking spaces to keep their existing clientele and draw new faces—a hard business landscape for them.</p>



<p><strong>The strain on Community Dynamics: Fracturing the Sense of Community</strong></p>



<p>The latter form of coworking spaces is driven by community interaction and collaboration in a way that, at times, unfails the virtual offices in their wake. This is so because, with less physical human presence, there is reduced camaraderie and a general sense of purpose, often leaving a gap among the members and diluting the vibrant atmosphere of coworking spaces.</p>



<p><strong>Financial Pressures: Tightening Budgets and Tough Decisions</strong></p>



<p>The virtual office has quite an economic effect on coworking. This must modulate with a dwindling membership at the coworking space and increasing competition, which now leads to an increasing financial heat. This leaves them making hard decisions on strict mechanisms that cut costs and pricing strategies to survive in a hostile market.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.cubispace.com/">Navigating the Virtual Office Storm</a></strong></p>



<p>It could also test for the opportunity to think innovatively and adaptively in the face of several challenges, such as plummeting membership, financial strains, and community dynamics.</p>



<p>This leaves plenty of room to define the value proposition further, strengthen community relationships, and find new revenue potentials so that coworking spaces can compete with virtual offices head-on and emerge all the better and more durable for it in this ever-evolving modern work environment.</p>



<p>However, virtual offices provide firm challenges, but they also offer opportunities for innovation and adaptation to coworking spaces. This is done through understanding how the dynamic needs of the members can satisfy the improvement of the level of community participation and using technology to improve the service of the workplace.</p>



<p>Ultimately, therefore, coworking spaces can continue to flourish amidst the current thrust in the landscape of modern work by accepting this change while at the same time remaining true to their central values of collaboration and community.</p>

They offer various membership plans, such as daily passes, part-time memberships, hot desks, dedicated desks, and private offices, each with different pricing tiers based on usage and amenities.</p>

<p><strong>6. Additional Services:</strong> Coworking spaces may offer extra services like printing and scanning facilities, high-speed internet access, storage lockers, and catering services. These add-ons provide convenience to members and create additional revenue streams.</p>
<p><strong>7. Partnerships and Sponsorships:</strong> Coworking spaces can partner with local businesses or service providers to offer exclusive deals to their members. In return, these partnerships may lead to commissions or sponsorships, benefiting both parties.</p>
<p><strong>8. Corporate Memberships:</strong> Some coworking spaces offer corporate membership packages tailored to businesses with multiple employees. Corporate memberships often come with additional benefits and discounts, making them an attractive option for companies.</p>
<p><strong>9. Affiliate Programs:</strong> Coworking spaces can join affiliate programs with various service providers, such as software companies or office supply vendors. When their members purchase products or services through these partnerships, the coworking space earns a commission.</p>
<p><strong>10. Workshops and Events:</strong> Coworking spaces may organize workshops, training sessions, or educational events. These events not only add value to the community but also generate revenue through ticket sales or additional fees.</p>
<p>By combining these revenue streams and maintaining a vibrant and supportive community, coworking spaces can achieve financial sustainability and continue to provide valuable services to their members.</p></p><li style="list-style:none" class="elementor-repeater-item-127739e"><h3><span>4. </span> How do i start a coworking office?</h3><p><p>Starting a coworking office can be a rewarding venture if done right.

<p>The year 2020, was full of chaos and uncertainty. Growth rates of many industries were slowed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coworking industry has suffered the same fate. According to a report by Business Wire -“<em> The global coworking spaces market is expected to decline from $9.27 billion in 2019 and to $8.24 billion in 2020 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -12.9%. The decline is mainly due to economic slowdown across countries owing to the COVID-19 outbreak and the measures to contain it. The market is then expected to recover and reach $11.52 billion in 2023 at CAGR of 11.8%.</em>” For the coworking market to recover, we expect to see some major new trends that will take the coworking industry by storm this year.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>That said, in this article, we’ve listed out the Top 5 Coworking trends in the year 2021.</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><b>Focus on resources and amenities concerning health and hygiene.</b></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Coworking service providers will focus<br />more on safe and hygienic workplace environments. There will be a rise in<br />covid-19 compliant workspaces.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Services like: Air purifiers, Thermal scanning, Hourly sanitization, etc will be a must.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Moreover, Companies like <a href="https://www.safeworkspaze.online/"><strong>Safeworkspaze</strong></a> have partnered with many coworking providers to deliver the services mentioned above.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Large enterprises will move their workforce to Coworking spaces</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The year 2020 will always be remembered<br />to be the year when the Corona-virus hit the world. One other thing it will be<br />remembered for is how it&#8217;s been a real game-changer for businesses in<br />redefining and reshaping the way people work.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Large companies are actively implementing<br />the Work From Home model or similar hybrid models. This will, in turn, increase<br />demand for coworking spaces as companies will try to leverage the advantages of<br />flexible space-as-a-service and office decentralization.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Increase in requests for private offices compared to individual seats</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2021, we will see a rise in demand for private office space compared to individual seats. Coworking Resources observed a 76% higher share of requests for private offices compared to individual seats after analyzing over 3,000 requests between February 2020  (pre-lockdowns) and May 2020 (post-lockdowns). With new strands of the virus emerging from all around the globe, requests for private offices are only expected to increase.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Virtualization of coworking spaces</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One unique trend that we will see this year is <strong><a href="https://www.propques.com/start-coworking-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="virtual coworking spaces (opens in a new tab)">virtual coworking spaces</a></strong>. Virtual coworking spaces provide many of the same benefits as a physical coworking space with more affordable prices. Instead of physically going to the location, you will have to log in to your coworking portal. The main benefits of virtualization will be the ability to socialize and network with like-minded people from all around the globe.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Increase in Coworking spaces in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. </strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to an article by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-some-professionals-are-quitting-the-big-city/articleshow/76357825.cms">Times of India</a>, before the pandemic, the top seven cities accounted for almost 70% of India’s residential population. This figure is most likely to change as more and more people are moving to their home cities due to the work from home culture. This trend will increase the demand for coworking spaces in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. To tackle this problem, We work is planning to introduce a new <strong>WFNH</strong> (Work from Near Home) model in which it will open coworking spaces within cycling distance from peoples homes, making the coworking space more accessible and available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The pandemic might have caused some hiccups for the coworking industry but with large enterprises turning towards coworking providers to fill in the gap between WFH models and traditional workspaces, the demand for <a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="coworking space (opens in a new tab)"><strong>coworking space</strong></a> will only increase.</p>

<p>What meditations do for us? It relaxes our senses, gives us the time to think around and focus on our future goals. We can consider this pandemic time the same for our co-working enterprises, as it has given us the time to review our strategies and decisions. We can evaluate the steps we took for our business in the past. And also can formulate a policy that we can follow to overcome the current downfall.<br>
For soon, things are going to come back to normal, obviously with bit twisted demands. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> So, co-working operators and property owners must re-think their plans and mould them according to the changing requirements. Because, without a well-thought-of plan of action, it would be tough to survive high competition after the COVID. Utilize this pandemic time to plan out strategies in advance with co-working consultants. For when COVID is gone, you must not waste a single day to escalate your revenues. Expert findings and forecasts have given a ray of hope to co-working operators and property owners. Seeing the industry trends and steps taken by major corporate, assumptions are office work will take a shift towards flexible spaces and serviced offices from traditional ones. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Multiple reasons are behind this trend of choosing flexible offices</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --><p></p>
<li> First, they are suitable to changing requirements and needs like reduction in staff, modern design, premium location, etc.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li> Secondly, they don’t bring the burden of multiple fixed operating expenses; this saves time, money, and effort. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Third, employees are also quite happier and satisfied with the flexible office concept. And, there are many other reasons too but, that will need a separate discussion.   </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>  Bring your best minds together to chalk out a strategy that can help you to overcome the losses. Take the support of experienced co-working consultancies to discuss new strategies and plans to make the best use of the after COVID period. As more flexible offices will pour in eyeing the increased demands, also existing operators will put their best foot forward to establish and expand themselves. The need will be to employ new marketing and sales strategies to handle the competition to steer ahead.     </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Although this period is a setback for every industry, the coming days promise a much better and prosperous future for the co-workings. Think of this time as ‘Time Out period of 20-20 matches,’ where you can work out team strategy, assess the match played till then, and formulate new policies for future challenges.</p>

<p><strong>While coworking is not new (Regus dates back to 1989), the modern concept originated on the West Coast in the mid-2000s, with a focus on community, collaboration and interaction.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditional offices have recently been superseded by coworking spaces which have proliferated all over the world. Because their core idea is based on the creation of a thriving community and fostering networking, such offices are becoming more and more popular among millennials and, thus profitable for their owners. Not only is it a great choice for small and growing businesses but also the concept of shared spaces is chosen by&nbsp;big corporations. The latter often set up innovation labs within the walls of shared space venues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How Coworking Influences Commercial Real Estate:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Facilities Management</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coworking means sharing. But it does not just stop at sharing the workspace. Costs associated with electricity, security, the Internet, etc. are divided between all of the tenants of a coworking space. This works beneficially for all parties involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compared to renting a regular office, a coworking space offers a cheaper alternative to traditional offices for freelancers and companies. At the same time, business operators overall earn more on facilities management service despite charging a low cost per client.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Smart Building Technology</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of coworking spaces apply smart technologies when designing and building a venue. A lot of processes are becoming automated from visitor management and heating to cloud access control and cutting-edge security. This makes coworking spaces not only more attractive to professionals but also sustainable and forward-thinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Brokerage<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coworkingresources.org/blog/coworking-space-agreement&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1539898990316000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#x200d;</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coworking space agreements</a>&nbsp;are usually less complicated than the traditional ones. They are flexible and allow short-time leasing. There is a possibility to rent a working space even on an hourly basis. This is a definite advantage for fast-growing businesses. As they develop, they make use of the scalability offered by coworking spaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brokers might become less influential in the future, as the relationship between a space provider and a client will be a direct one. Brokerage might shift towards advising, as it is expected that there will be a reduced number of long-term leasing agreements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Understanding of Workplace</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A workplace of the future is more than an office. It can offer a working space, a communal area, a coffee shop, a kindergarten, and a gym. It is flexible, it is attractive, and it boosts creativity. And that’s what the generation of millennials needs. They are not bound by the 9 to 5 rules. They value money and the freedom it gives, and they cherish when work and leisure can be combined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Project Management</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because coworking venues are pre-furnished, well-maintained and have all the facilities included in the price, companies should not worry about spending a fortune on fit-outs and improvements which they otherwise would have to go through in case of leasing a traditional office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What will it be in the future?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At present, traditional real estate owners have started to adopt some of the best things about coworking—better employee work experiences, shared resources, a wide range of workplaces, and happy working hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the commercial landlord has already seen many changes, there is still more to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>More space redevelopment.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With commercial real estate showing no sign of slowing down and with a growing demand for coworking space from the advent of freelancing, coworking, and hybrids, more real estate developers and coworking operators are extending their ventures to secondary and tertiary markets in anticipation of gaining more profit.</p>

<p><strong><em>&#8216;Flex seat enquiries up 17% Y-o-Y in Tier II cities&#8217;</em></strong></p>



<p><br>Start-ups, SMEs and companies in the fintech and e-commerce segments focusing on emerging economic centres and smaller towns for business growth and enterprises looking to tap into the talent pool of an increasingly mobile workforce are the mainstays of this rise in enquiries for flex seats in Tier II cities as per the report.<br>Chandigarh, Indore and Lucknow are seeing robust traction for flex enquiries. In fact, there is good traction across major Tier II cities in the North, West and South.<br><a href="https://www.apnnews.com/flex-seat-transactions-up-2-5x-y-on-year-for-fy-2021-22-jll-qdesq-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Source "><em>Source</em> </a></p>



<p>The key factors driving the market growth are increasing work flexibility and remote work culture, growing freelancers&#8217; population and increasing demand for shared office spaces. However, lack of awareness about coworking spaces among small businesses is restraining the market growth.<br><em><a href="https://www.openpr.com/news/2645071/coworking-space-services-market-is-estimated-to-rise-at-a-cagr">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for flex seats has been growing strongly. The total gross office space leasing across eight major cities stood at 52.6 million square feet, while the net office space leasing was 21 million square feet during the last year. The new supply of office space stood at 38 million square feet.<br><em><a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/business/coworking-firms-take-on-lease-21-more-office-space-in-2021-report-news-31708">Source</a></em></p>



<p>A lot of small as well as large firms are popping up right now, and they are looking forward to co-working office spaces. With cheap internet access, technology is developing by huge strides, there is nothing permanent when it comes to workplace space. Most businesses are attempting to keep things more compact, rather than occupying a large leased area for a decade or more. Companies consider obtaining aesthetically pleasing co-working work spaces ideal for high-end client meetings. In India, there is an increasing need for Managed Work Spaces. This is another important reason why the number of flexible spaces in India is expected to double by 2025.<br><em><a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/money/how-co-working-office-spaces-will-look-in-2025/2503908/">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Coworking operators sold over 55,000 seats in 2021, up from 36,000 seats in 2020, according to property experts, and they expect sales to double in 2022.<br><em><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-bytes/flexible-spaces-demand-may-hit-a-new-high-in-2022/articleshow/89085341.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst">Source</a></em></p>



<p>In the last 18 months, the pandemic has not only redesigned the entire coworking ecosystem but has also encouraged real estate developers to join hands with coworking operators to create such special spaces.<br>Interested in short, crisp &amp; relevant content on finger tips? | Download People Matters Sphere now! People matters SPHERE Google Play App Store<br>According to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report, coworking operators expanded their portfolio aggressively last year and took on lease 21 per cent more office area &#8211; 4.91 million square feet in 2021 from 4.05 million square feet in the previous year &#8211; across the top eight cities of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad to meet the rising demand for flexible workspaces from corporates amid the pandemic.<br><em><a href="https://www.peoplematters.in/article/talent-management/2022-the-beginning-of-a-golden-era-of-co-working-spaces-32318">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Demand for co-working office space jumped over two-fold in the last fiscal year at 90,200 desks across seven major cities as flexible workspaces rose in prominence after 2nd wave of the pandemic.<br><em><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/flexible-workspace-demand-jumps-two-fold-to-90-200-desks-in-fy22-report-122062000832_1.html">Source</a></em></p>



<p>There is a strong demand for co-working spaces and this has pushed co-working businesses to launch more centres in metropolises and other demand generating areas. Today, co-working spaces have become the most sought-after assets and their share in office leasing is anticipated to rise from a mere 2% in 2010 to 13% by 2024.<br><em><a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/money/startups-to-lead-the-demand-for-co-working-spaces-in-india/2517149/">Source</a></em></p>

<p><strong>When you make the crucial shift from landlord to operator, your business experience will be more personal and rewarding. Here are some things to think about as you make this step:</strong></p>



<p>Coworking, shared office business models transform how we work and live because they can adapt to the needs of demand by offering flexibility and access to a community.</p>



<p>Today we are more in need of spaces that offer us more than just the ability to work, and co-working spaces have become one of the tools to achieve this. As coworking operators start up in specific areas, it is not only about offering affordable office space but also about providing a wide variety of services for community members, including facilities for work, learning or play.</p>



<p>Besides property managers and owners, there are also those who take on the management of this type of business. They want to be close and have a direct relationship with the final user. For this reason, the value chain is becoming shorter and shorter: we find property owners that have become operators&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propques.com/clients/">( Summit space , Cubispace, workjar )</a>&nbsp;.</p>



<p>if you are a mere rent collector, have no strategy or generate no value, you are out of business. And to generate value, you need to know the end user well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agreements between the landlord and the operator</h3>



<p>Coworking can be classified according to their management model. In other words, according to the contractual relationship between the owner and operator:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Owner as operator:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>One of the owners also operates the coworking business.</li>



<li>He has 100% control over the business, profits and losses.</li>



<li>Here is where the risk lies. If you do not know this sector, it could be a mess. The less you know, the more risky your investment will be.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lease agreement:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>The owner leases the asset to a third party.</li>



<li>The rent can be fixed or variable (with a guaranteed minimum rent).</li>



<li>The owner has no control over the business and only deals with the real estate business.</li>



<li>In the case of renting with variable income, the owner participates indirectly in the good performance of the business.</li>



<li>The FF&amp;E (Furniture, Fixtures &amp; Equipment) by property owner and OS&amp;E (Operating Supplies &amp; Equipment) investment is assumed by the tenant.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Management fee agreement:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>The owner hires an operator with extensive knowledge of the industry to manage the coworking operations.</li>



<li>The hired operator receives a&nbsp;<em>management fee as compensation</em>.</li>



<li>The entire business (asset + coworking operations) belongs to the owner.</li>



<li>The owner has no control over the business.</li>



<li>The entire construction investment is made by the owner.</li>



<li>The risk is assumed by the owner.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.propques.com/" title=""><strong>Propques management agreement:</strong></a></h3>



<ul>
<li>The owner hires&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propques.com/" title="">Propques as a consultant</a>&nbsp;with extensive knowledge and experience in the sector to develop the entire project and manage the coworking operations under the owner’s brand.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.propques.com/" title="">Propques transfers the know-how to the owner:</a>&nbsp;in the third year, the owner starts to manage the business with a trained and experimented team as well as being handed the Operations Manual of the business.</li>



<li>Propques receives a&nbsp;<em>management fee as compensation</em>.</li>



<li>The entire business (asset + coworking operations) belongs to the owner.</li>



<li>The owner has control of the business from the third year.</li>



<li>The entire construction investment is made by the owner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coworking is a trend that is on the rise, and for good reason. It has been shown to boost productivity, creativity, and collaboration among its members. And as the workforce continues to evolve, coworking will become even more popular. If you’re not familiar with coworking, it’s time to get up to speed. In this blog post, we will explore the top coworking trends you need to know. From the rise of remote workers to the popularity of flex spaces, read on to learn more about this growing trend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rise of Coworking Trend Spaces</h2>



<p>The rise of coworking has been one of the most talked about trends in recent years. And it&#8217;s no wonder why.</p>



<p>Coworking spaces provide a flexible, affordable, and convenient way to work, whether you&#8217;re a freelancer, small business owner or startup founder. And with the rise of the gig economy and more people working remotely, coworking spaces have become even more popular.</p>



<p>This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of coworking, the rise of the gig economy and the need for more flexible working arrangements.</p>



<p>So what is driving this trend? Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the key factors:</p>



<p>The Gig Economy: The rise of the gig economy has been a major factor in the growth of coworking spaces. With more people working freelance or contract jobs, there&#8217;s a need for flexible, affordable workspace solutions that can be accessed on demand. Coworking spaces provide the perfect solution for these workers, who often don&#8217;t have access to traditional office space.</p>



<p>The Need for Flexibility: Another factor driving the growth of coworking is the need for more flexible working arrangements. With advances in technology making it easier to work remotely, more people are looking for alternatives to traditional offices. Coworking spaces provide a flexible and convenient way to work, without being tied</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2022 Best Coworking Trends</h2>



<p>Coworking is no longer a new concept. In fact, it’s been around for over a decade now. And in that time, it’s undergone quite a few changes.</p>



<p>So what can we expect from coworking in 2022? Here are some of the best coworking trends to keep an eye out for:</p>



<p>1. Virtual Offices</p>



<p>With more and more people working remotely, the demand for virtual offices is on the rise. A virtual office is a type of coworking space that allows members to work from anywhere in the world, using a variety of online tools and services.</p>



<p>2. Flexible Workspaces</p>



<p>Flexible workspace is another trend on the rise in recent years. This type of workspace gives employees the ability to choose when and where they want to work. This could mean working from home two days a week and coming into the office for the other three days, or it could mean working from different coworking spaces throughout the week.</p>



<p>3. Coworking Cafes</p>



<p>Coworking cafes are popping up all over the world as people look for more social and relaxed coworking environments. These cafes offer a place to work, along with food and drink options, making them ideal for those who want to take a break from their usual office or home setup.</p>



<p>4. Collaborative Workspaces</p>



<p>Collaborative workspace is another growing trend in the coworking world</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coworking Advantages</h2>



<p>There are plenty of advantages that come with coworking, which is why the trend has been on the rise in recent years. For starters, it can help to increase productivity and creativity thanks to the collaboration and sense of community that coworking spaces provide. Additionally, it can be a more cost-effective way to work since you won&#8217;t have to pay for your own office space or equipment. And last but not least, it can offer a better work/life balance since you&#8217;ll have the flexibility to choose your own hours and work from anywhere.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Coworking Space?</h2>



<p>A coworking space is a shared office environment where individuals from different companies or organizations can come together to work. It’s a flexible way to get office space without the need for a long-term lease or the hassle of setting up your own office.</p>



<p>Coworking spaces typically provide desks, chairs, and other basic office furniture, as well as Wi-Fi and printer access. Some also offer additional amenities like coffee and snack bars, conference rooms, and on-site childcare. Prices vary depending on the location and amenities offered, but they are often much cheaper than renting your own office space.</p>



<p>The coworking trend has been growing in popularity in recent years as more people work remotely or freelance. Coworking spaces provide a sense of community and collaboration that many remote workers crave. And since most spaces offer flexible membership options, it’s easy to try out coworking without making a long-term commitment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to start a coworking Space business</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about starting a coworking space business, there are a few things you should know about the current trends in the industry. First, the demand for coworking spaces is growing rapidly. Many of the largest coworking space operators are now expanding into new markets and offering additional services such as private offices, meeting rooms, and event space.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in starting your own coworking space business, we&#8217;ve put together a few tips to help you get started:</p>



<p>1. Do your research: The first step is to understand the demand for coworking spaces in your area and what kind of prices people are willing to pay. You can do this by searching online for coworking spaces in your city or town and seeing how many results come up. You can also check out websites like DeskSurfing and WeWork Labs to get an idea of the average prices charged by similar businesses.</p>



<p>2. Create a business plan: Once you have an idea of the demand and pricing for coworking spaces in your area, you&#8217;ll need to create a detailed business plan that outlines how you intend to start and operate your business.</p>



<p>If you want more information to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propques.com/start-coworking-business/">start your own coworking space</a>&nbsp;and control your business 100% by minimizing risks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propques.com/" title="">contact us.</a>&nbsp;We offer integral service for developing your coworking project from conceptualization to business implementation until the 3rd or 5th year.
