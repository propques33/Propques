<p>When it comes to the bright and bouncing-back world of the coworking industry, making high profits is not limited to the desks and Wi-Fi setup alone. It all comes down to thinking outside the box and coming up with pretty intelligent ways for making that extra moolah. Here are five simple ways through which you can explain to your coworking space on how best it can derive revenue and stay ahead.</p>



<p>1. Host Fun Events: Make Your Space the Place to Be Turn your coworking space into a cool events spot that people love to visit. From workshops to parties, several other things might be happening in the space, including giving birth to some of the trends.<br><br>By hosting events at the center, they reveal the space not only by renting it but also renting drinks and snacks sold at the occasion and helping in organizing the event. With some clever marketing, your space could become the go-to spot for all kinds of gatherings.</p>



<p>2. Special Membership Offer: Treat Your best customers like vIPs<br></p>



<p>Offer a special membership package to your most valued customers in such a way that makes them feel really special, exceeding the levels of a typical customer. Private desks, inviting space to exclusive events, or personal help when they need it. If people are ready to pay more for privileged treatment, such types of memberships also raise your space&#8217;s revenue.</p>



<p>&nbsp;3.Froster connections and a collaborative environment: Build connections and boost your earnings by collaborating with other businesses. Create exclusive offers for your members, such as discounted gym memberships conveniently located just across the street. Forge partnerships with nearby cafes to ensure that your members always enjoy affordable coffee options. Let&#8217;s foster a community where networking not only leads to friendships but also to financial benefits.</p>



<p>To sum up, by helping you work with others, this section will help you give extra value to your members, and hopefully, earn yourself some extra cash along the way through referral fees and other agreements.</p>



<p>4. Be Flexible: Change with the Times<br><br>The way people work is always changing, so it&#8217;s important to be flexible.Offer different kinds of workspaces, like virtual offices or short-term rentals, which would meet different people&#8217;s needs. Being versatile guarantees that you are occupying 100 percent space, hence an assured opportunity to make that extra dollar around the clock all year.</p>



<p>5. Offer Extra Services: Give People What They Want<br><br>Think of what else your members may need and offer it. They most likely need computer help or would like to learn some new skills. You will also have a chance at earning an extra profit and, in the process, create satisfaction among them through additional services like IT support or workshops.</p>



<p>In summary, therefore, the quest to make more in this business leaves one to have to be creative, work with others, and give people what they want. There are easy approaches for the host of events, special memberships, partnering with others, being flexible, and offering extra services that could help increase revenues and make the coworking space successful.</p>

<p>The concept of working from virtual offices has become the new normal. The setup is digitized so that one can work from absolutely anywhere while projecting a professional view. This trend challenges the coworking industry in spaces known as &#8220;the communal work hubs where people and small businesses come together,&#8221; as the dictionary defines them. Look at how virtual offices are damaging coworking spaces and how they can be mitigated.</p>



<p><strong>The Decline in Membership: Empty Desks and Diminishing Foot Traffic</strong></p>



<p>Many coworking spaces are losing memberships as the pool of<a href="/"> virtual offices</a> grows and becomes a rising trend.</p>



<p>People are going contemporary, finding it more comfortable to work from wherever they are and prefer to avoid signing up for a physical office. This leaves many coworking spaces with empty desks, low foot traffic, and non-vibrancy.</p>



<p><strong>Disruption in the Coworking Landscape: Shifting Demands and Expectations</strong></p>



<p>With its members&#8217; changing needs and expectations, coworking spaces still have to align themselves with the new norm of a virtual office. This attractiveness of remote work is forcing rethinking among most people and companies about the need for physical office spaces, and the trend has resulted in falling numbers of members at traditional coworking spaces.</p>



<p>That will make hybrid work models, which meld full-time and part-time remote and in-person collaboration for coworking spaces, all the more confusing.</p>



<p><strong>Competition for Clients: Losing the Battle for Business</strong></p>



<p>Virtual offices have made the competition tough for coworking spaces to attract customers. This has now become a phenomenon that benefits businesses and freelancers not attached to a location. It has increased the scramble of the coworking spaces to keep their existing clientele and draw new faces—a hard business landscape for them.</p>



<p><strong>The strain on Community Dynamics: Fracturing the Sense of Community</strong></p>



<p>The latter form of coworking spaces is driven by community interaction and collaboration in a way that, at times, unfails the virtual offices in their wake. This is so because, with less physical human presence, there is reduced camaraderie and a general sense of purpose, often leaving a gap among the members and diluting the vibrant atmosphere of coworking spaces.</p>



<p><strong>Financial Pressures: Tightening Budgets and Tough Decisions</strong></p>



<p>The virtual office has quite an economic effect on coworking. This must modulate with a dwindling membership at the coworking space and increasing competition, which now leads to an increasing financial heat. This leaves them making hard decisions on strict mechanisms that cut costs and pricing strategies to survive in a hostile market.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.cubispace.com/">Navigating the Virtual Office Storm</a></strong></p>



<p>It could also test for the opportunity to think innovatively and adaptively in the face of several challenges, such as plummeting membership, financial strains, and community dynamics.</p>



<p>This leaves plenty of room to define the value proposition further, strengthen community relationships, and find new revenue potentials so that coworking spaces can compete with virtual offices head-on and emerge all the better and more durable for it in this ever-evolving modern work environment.</p>



<p>However, virtual offices provide firm challenges, but they also offer opportunities for innovation and adaptation to coworking spaces. This is done through understanding how the dynamic needs of the members can satisfy the improvement of the level of community participation and using technology to improve the service of the workplace.</p>



<p>Ultimately, therefore, coworking spaces can continue to flourish amidst the current thrust in the landscape of modern work by accepting this change while at the same time remaining true to their central values of collaboration and community.</p>

<p>Coworking spaces have become increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more people move away from traditional office settings. Coworking spaces offer a number of advantages for businesses of all sizes, including flexibility, affordability, and a sense of community.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re considering <a href="/2023/08/18/invest-in-coworking-space-in-india/" data-type="link" data-id="/2023/08/18/invest-in-coworking-space-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>investing in a coworking space</strong></a>, there are a few things you need to know. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll discuss the top five reasons why investing in a coworking space in 2023 is a smart move.</p>



<p><strong>1. Coworking spaces are a growing trend</strong></p>



<p>The coworking industry is growing rapidly and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. This is due to a number of factors, including the rise of remote work, the increasing number of freelancers and entrepreneurs, and the need for more flexible workspaces.</p>



<p>As the coworking industry continues to grow, so too will the demand for coworking spaces. This means that investors in coworking spaces can expect to see good returns on their investment.</p>



<p><strong>2. Coworking spaces are affordable</strong></p>



<p>Coworking spaces are a more affordable option than traditional office space. This is because coworking spaces typically offer a variety of membership options, so businesses can choose the option that best fits their needs and budget.</p>



<p>In addition, coworking spaces typically include all of the amenities that businesses need, such as high-speed internet, conference rooms, and printing services. This means that businesses don&#8217;t have to worry about incurring additional costs for these amenities.</p>



<p><strong>3. Coworking spaces offer flexibility</strong></p>



<p><a href="/2023/05/05/what-features-make-a-coworking-space-the-best-type-of-workspace/" data-type="link" data-id="/2023/05/05/what-features-make-a-coworking-space-the-best-type-of-workspace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Coworking spaces offer</strong></a> businesses a great deal of flexibility. Businesses can rent a desk, a private office, or a team space for as long or as short as they need. This flexibility is especially appealing to businesses that are growing or downsizing, or that need to move frequently.</p>



<p>In addition, coworking spaces typically offer flexible hours, so businesses can come and go as they need. This is ideal for businesses with employees who work different hours or need to meet with clients outside of traditional business hours.</p>



<p><strong>4. Coworking spaces provide a sense of community</strong></p>

Coworkers come from a variety of industries and backgrounds, which can lead to new ideas, partnerships, and collaborations.</p>



<p>Coworking spaces also typically host events and workshops, which can help businesses learn new skills and network with other professionals.</p>



<p><strong>5. Coworking spaces are environmentally friendly</strong></p>



<p>Coworking spaces are typically more environmentally friendly than traditional office spaces. This is because coworking spaces are typically shared by multiple businesses, which reduces the amount of energy and resources that are consumed.</p>



<p>In addition, coworking spaces often have sustainable features, such as recycled materials, energy-efficient appliances, and natural light.</p>



<p><strong>How to invest in a coworking space</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in investing in a coworking space, there are a few things you need to do.</p>



<p>First, you need to research the coworking industry and identify the market opportunity in your area. You also need to develop a business plan and determine how you will finance your investment.</p>



<p>Once you have a business plan in place, you need to find a suitable location for your coworking space. The location should be centrally located and easily accessible by public transportation. It should also be in a safe and desirable neighborhood.</p>



<p>Once you have found a location, you need to build out your coworking space. This will involve furnishing the space and providing the necessary amenities, such as high-speed internet, conference rooms, and printing services.</p>



<p>Finally, you need to market your coworking space to potential members. You can do this through online and offline marketing channels.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the popularity of affordable coworking spaces.

This creates opportunities for networking, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.</p>



<p>One of the key advantages of these shared workspaces is their affordability.

<p>Creative coworking spaces have also emerged as popular options within this affordable coworking trend. These spaces are designed to inspire creativity and innovation through their unique layouts, vibrant decor, and collaborative environments. They often incorporate features such as communal areas for brainstorming sessions, dedicated meeting rooms for client presentations, and even recreational areas for relaxation.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the rise of affordable coworking spaces has revolutionized the way people work by providing accessible alternatives to traditional office setups. With their affordability, flexibility, and creative environments, these shared workspaces have become invaluable resources for freelancers, startups,and small businesses seeking cost-effective yet professional working solutions.</p>

<p>Infosys recently announced permanent Work From Home for 33% to 55% of its employees. On similar lines, TCS too claimed that by 2025, only 25% of its workforce will be coming its offices. As traditional workplaces decentralise, and WFH fatigue kicks in, coworking spaces will be in their best position to showcase themselves as ad-hoc solutions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t we convinced already that work from home cannot be a permanent set-up for India? Coworking units will now act as ad-hoc spaces while enterprises try to figure out the new normal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h2><strong>What will businesses look out for in a coworking space post COVID-19?</strong></h2>

<p><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Take the example of Chennai-based Karya Spaces for example. Karya Spaces opened a new centre in Nungambakkam in January. Instead of making the most of the booming commercial real estate industry, witnessed a massive downfall as client base dropped by 30% in March.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, since the lockdown restrictions have been eased in May, nearly 100 enquiries to rent desks are flooding in. For any company to develop and thrive, real-life interaction of the workforce is essential. And that&#8217;s where the importance of offices, or rather coworking spaces kicks in.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We did some research and most employees when given a choice between an office and a coworking space, would choose the latter. Unlike traditional offices, a coworking space encourages people to interact with those from similar and different businesses.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It’s like an informal collaboration of sorts because you can exchange fresh ideas, perspectives, and contacts.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before the pandemic, coworking spaces that offered 450 seats are cutting it down to say 240 seats to maintain social distancing. They are also providing safety equipments, setting new hygiene protocols, handsfree entries, etc.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To attract businesses and ensure the safety of the workforce, coworking spaces are moving from a rental model to a hospitality set-up. In addition to infrastructure and safety measures, they are also providing new services, software, etc.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Landlords and property owners that meet and exceed these new expectations can greatly benefit from the coworking boom that&#8217;s already upon us. As JLL predicts, corporate demand will grow significantly after the pandemic, as many major companies like Starbucks, Microsoft, and Facebook are already on the lookout for coworking spaces.</p>

<p>Coworking spaces are a boon for startups and small businesses. They are cost effective, flexible, and allow people from diverse backgrounds to congregate and collaborate with each other to resolve business and social challenges of the day. These benefits gave rise to a spike of coworking office leasing from 8 percent in 2018 to 14 percent in 2019.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In recent few years, larger companies too, especially in the tech industry, have started identifying the benefits of operating in a coworking space. In fact, a survey conducted by a real estate firm showcased that 40 to 45 percent of demand came from large firms. This demand for coworking office lease was followed by the SME sector at 35 to 40 percent, and interestingly the demand from start-ups came at just 15-25 percent.</p>

For instance, if a business needs to work on a special project that requires setting up a satellite or remote office, it is convenient to choose a coworking space than to lease for a fixed amount of time. Similarly, if a company finds the location of a particular coworking space suitable for their needs, it gives them an opportunity for expansion as well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Even the company employees can now opt between working at a head office or operating from a convenient location.</p>

<p>Thanks to coworking spaces, large corporations can save on their operational costs, opportunity cost, and also rental cost. They also spend less on internet, furniture, reception, housekeeping, and other office facilities.</p>

<p>As companies are looking for a more flexible office space format and remote workers requesting part-time offices away from home, the workspace sector seems to be on its path to reach normalcy. On that positive note, here are the emerging space utilization trends that our experts predict to be essential for a new normal world.</p>



<p><strong>Declutter the Floor</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-2327 size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.propques.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1.jpg" alt="coworking space" class="wp-image-2327"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Declutter the Floor</figcaption></figure>



<p>We are breaking out divisions into separate offices because adjacent offices with glass in between provide the feeling of proximity. This redesigning idea helps retain the division of space while also enhancing the buzz of energy and exchanging ideas. We are also enabling coworking businesses design lounge spaces and break-out spaces to collaborate or work alongside each other. These areas eliminate the sense of silo created by the more conventional office and cubicle grid format. Of course, all floor plan design changes are undertaken with COVID-19 compliance safety in mind.</p>



<p>Our team is designing easy access zones for hand-sanitizers, gloves, and masks. We are informing our clients and their property managers on the importance of frequent disinfecting and social contracts like not using the middle seats of couches or following social distancing.</p>



<p><strong>Activity-Based Working Spaces</strong></p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.propques.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2.jpg" alt="" width="1430" height="953">Introduce activity-based working spaces designed for the type of work an employee needs to do on a given day.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul>
<li>Open and comfortable areas for group work sessions</li>



<li>Isolated quiet areas</li>



<li>Open lounge areas</li>
</ul>



<p>These spaces boost efficiency and productivity as coworkers can choose the space they find the most comfort in depending on the task they need to complete. These features in a <a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>coworking space</strong></a> increase interaction and collaboration and foster creative thinking and innovation.</p>



<p><strong>Fresh Air &amp; Natural Sunlight</strong></p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.propques.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3.jpg" alt="" width="5041" height="3361">According to an HBR study in 2019, natural sunlight was the #1 factor for employee happiness. This holds particularly true for the current scenario as we have employees working from home for months together. So, the trend for natural sunlight and fresh air is here to stay and become essential.</p>



<p>We encourage the use of terraces and sunny offices with windows in your workspace.</p>



<p><strong>Flexible Leases</strong></p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.propques.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4.png" alt="" width="1430" height="804">The demand for flexible leases is accelerating steadily, with a steep trajectory from 5% to 30%. Not only startups and medium-sized companies, but also large enterprises are opting for coworking spaces over traditional office setups because the immediate return to normal requires teams to rotate days onsite. So, financially speaking, coworking spaces look like a smart idea due to the flexibility in leases offered by them.</p>



<p>We are helping coworking space owners to chalk out new lease agreements and membership plans to attract clients.</p>



<p>We expect this overview to inspire everyone to update the workstation environment by bringing the new standard. When done correctly, it will motivate coworkers to stay productive and efficient.</p>



<p>Get in touch via <a href="mailto:buzz@propques.com"><strong>buzz@propques.com</strong></a> to know about more efficient workspace utilization services in your city.</p>

<p>These are testing times for the coworking industry, and it is more important than ever to understand where the market is headed. Hence, we bring you the Global Coworking Study 2020 that explores the future of the coworking sector.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By 2024, the number of <a href="https://www.propques.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>coworking spaces</strong></a> worldwide is estimated to cross 40,000. The commercial real estate industry will grow at a slower pace this year, but it&#8217;s going to rebound and develop even more rapidly post 2020 at a yearly growth rate of over 21%.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As per our field experts, approximately 5 million people will be working from coworking spaces by 2024.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Insights</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Though the COVID-19 lockdown bought the growth of the coworking industry to a screeching halt, the overall outlook for 2021 seems extremely positive.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We even evaluated data from the 2019 Coworker Member’s Choice Awards. It showcases that before the coronavirus hit the world economy, 77% of the coworking operators planned to expand by opening new locations. Additionally, 32% of operators planned to open one new location by 2020, and 38% planned to open 2 to 3 new locations.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It seems that almost 9% of respondents said they plan to open 8+ new locations by the end of 2020. These projections show that many multi-location spaces are turning into small chains that serve entire regions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Size &amp; Capacity</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Coworker’s Coworking Size &amp; Capacity Report, Asia is the continent with the highest average capacity of 114 people. Next in line is South America with the lowest average capacity of 54 people. China ranked as the country with the largest capacity, with 282 people on average per space (within Asia). In terms of space size though, the country with the largest spaces in the world is North America, with an average size of 9,799 sq.ft. per space. This number is followed by Asia at 8,101 sq. ft.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As more businesses implement flexible working practices, the capacity to continue to create extra time will become increasingly essential to space operators, as serviced offices and remote teams are being built.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Geography</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With more than 3,700 workspaces across the world, America remains the biggest market. The second in position is India with 2,197 spaces, followed by United Kingdom with 1,044 spaces. When talking about annual growth in 2020, Germany and India are the two fastest-growing countries, followed by America and Canada.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Prices</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The downward trend in prices is mirrored in various regions in the world as the coworking industry becomes mainstream. However, in Europe prices increased by almost 12% over the past 2 years.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to country rankings, Monaco stayed on the top spot in 2019- 2020 for most expensive monthly hot desk price at $397 per month. This was followed by Switzerland at $395 per month and Malta with $347 per month.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<h3><strong>Post-COVID Predictions</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.propques.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" />We analyzed over 2,500 requests between February 2020 (pre-lockdowns) and May 2020 (post-lockdowns). It was observed that space utilization is beginning to recover and there&#8217;s a rising shift toward private offices, longer-term contract durations, and higher capacities of desks needed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Preliminary data shows 76% higher share of requests for private offices compared to individual seats, 26% higher number of seats per request, and 96% higher contract terms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In a post-COVID-19 world, demand is predicted to mainly come from larger organizations and enterprises that are looking to decentralize their workforces into smaller branch offices and private flex offices. That said, in the next couple of years, all offices will turn into flexible, on-demand spaces, which holds the potential for the coworking industry to grow and thrive.</p>
